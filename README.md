# Blind single image super resolution

In this repository I present a benchmark for comparing three prominent super-resolution models **EDSR vs UDRL vs KOALAnet**.

- EDSR: Enhanced Deep Residual Networks for Single Image Super-Resolution [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02921)
- UDRL: Unsupervised Degradation Representation Learning for Blind Super-Resolution [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00416)
- KOALAnet: KOALAnet: Blind Super-Resolution using Kernel-Oriented Adaptive Local Adjustment [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08103)

Both papers UDRL and KOALAnet share amazing results for blind image super resolution tasks. But, their training and testing methodologies differ a lot and we cannot conclude which model performs better than other. And this motivated me to create this project in which I carried out several experiments to compare these two models. I also compare UDRL and KOALAnet with a non-blind EDSR model and Bicubic interpolation baseline algorithm. Specifically I did the following - 

1. Create a common benchmark dataset and evaluated the pre-trained models released by the authors or found on internet.
2. Reproduced and trained the models from scratch and evaluated the trained models.
